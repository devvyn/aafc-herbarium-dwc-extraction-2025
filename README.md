# Herbarium OCR to Darwin Core

A toolkit for extracting data from herbarium specimen images and mapping the results to the Darwin Core standard.

This repository currently provides a minimal skeleton implementation with a command line interface and basic I/O utilities. It will be expanded to include OCR engines, quality control heuristics and full data mapping logic.
