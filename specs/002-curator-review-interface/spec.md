**Feature Branch**: `002-curator-review-interface`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Curator review interface that provides web-based tools for scientists to validate, correct, and approve OCR-extracted data before final export to institutional databases and GBIF"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature involves web interface for data validation and approval
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: curators, taxonomists, data managers
   ‚Üí Actions: review, validate, correct, approve, reject
   ‚Üí Data: OCR results, Darwin Core fields, specimen images
   ‚Üí Constraints: scientific accuracy, workflow efficiency, audit compliance
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear workflow for scientific data review
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Curator workflow from review to approval
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and verifiable
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Reviews, Approvals, Corrections, Workflows
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí No implementation details, focused on curator needs

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Museum curators and taxonomic experts need to efficiently review and validate OCR-extracted specimen data before it becomes part of institutional collections and global biodiversity databases. They require tools to quickly identify errors, make corrections, and maintain quality control across thousands of specimen records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** OCR extraction completed, **When** curator accesses review queue, **Then** they see prioritized list of specimens requiring validation
2. **Given** curator reviewing specimen, **When** viewing side-by-side image and extracted data, **Then** they can easily identify and correct taxonomic errors
3. **Given** uncertain taxonomic identification, **When** curator flags for expert review, **Then** specimen enters specialist workflow with appropriate notifications
4. **Given** data corrections made, **When** curator submits approval, **Then** changes are logged with timestamp and reviewer identity
5. **Given** batch review session, **When** processing multiple related specimens, **Then** system supports efficient keyboard navigation and bulk operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple curators attempt to review the same specimen simultaneously?
- How does system handle conflicting expert opinions on taxonomic identification?
- What occurs when original OCR data is corrupted or incomplete?
- How are urgent specimens (type specimens, loan requests) prioritized in review queue?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display specimen image alongside extracted data for visual validation
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide dropdown lists of valid taxonomic names from authoritative sources
- **FR-003**: System MUST support field-level confidence indicators to highlight uncertain extractions
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain complete audit trail of all reviewer actions and changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search and filter capabilities across specimen review queue
- **FR-006**: System MUST support role-based access with different permissions for curators vs specialists
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable bulk approval operations for validated specimen batches
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide real-time collaboration features to prevent duplicate review work
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate quality control reports showing review statistics and error patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with institutional authentication systems for secure access

### Key Entities
- **Review Task**: Individual specimen requiring curator validation with priority and assignment tracking
- **Validation Record**: Curator's assessment including corrections, confidence levels, and approval status
- **Quality Report**: Statistical analysis of review outcomes, error patterns, and curator performance
- **Workflow State**: Current position in review process from initial extraction to final approval
