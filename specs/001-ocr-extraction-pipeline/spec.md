## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Herbarium researchers need to digitize thousands of botanical specimens efficiently while maintaining scientific accuracy. They upload specimen images and receive structured Darwin Core data that meets institutional standards and can be submitted to GBIF for global biodiversity research.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** researcher has specimen images, **When** they upload images via interface, **Then** system extracts scientific names, collection data, and geographic information into Darwin Core format
2. **Given** OCR extraction complete, **When** curator reviews results, **Then** they can validate, correct, and approve data before export
3. **Given** validated data exists, **When** exporting for GBIF submission, **Then** output meets Darwin Core Archive standards and passes GBIF validation
4. **Given** processing multiple specimens, **When** batch processing initiated, **Then** system handles 100+ images efficiently with progress tracking

### Edge Cases
- What happens when specimen labels are damaged, faded, or partially illegible?
- How does system handle non-standard label formats or handwritten text?
- What occurs when scientific names don't match taxonomic authorities?
- How are duplicate specimens or re-digitized images handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract scientific names from specimen images with 95%+ accuracy
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture collection date, collector name, and location data from labels
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate extracted taxonomic names against GBIF backbone taxonomy
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate Darwin Core compliant data exports
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide curator review interface for validating extracted data
- **FR-006**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple specimen images
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain audit trail of all data changes and approvals
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle various image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF) up to 50MB per file
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide confidence scoring for all extracted fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with institutional database systems for specimen metadata

### Key Entities
- **Specimen**: Physical herbarium specimen with label containing scientific and collection data
- **Image**: Digital photograph of specimen with embedded label information
- **Darwin Core Record**: Structured data following Darwin Core standard with fields like scientificName, collectionDate, locality
- **OCR Result**: Raw text extraction from image with confidence scores and field mappings
- **Validation Report**: Curator review status, corrections, and approval workflow tracking
