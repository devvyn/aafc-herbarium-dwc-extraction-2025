**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08T00:25:00-06:00

## Current State

### Completed Tonight ‚úÖ
- **Batch 3**: 285 specimens extracted successfully
  - Quality: 98% scientificName, 95% catalogNumber coverage
  - Cost: $1.04
  - Provenance: Complete chain with SHA256 hashing
  - Location: `production_v1_batch3/`

### In Progress üîÑ
- **Batch 1**: 1,300 specimens (blocked by OpenAI queue limit, retrying)
- **Batch 2**: 1,300 specimens (blocked by OpenAI queue limit, retrying)

### Technical Enhancements ‚öôÔ∏è
- ‚úÖ Batch splitting implemented (--offset parameter)
- ‚úÖ Provenance architecture integrated
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider strategy designed

## Tomorrow's Plan

### Budget Approved: $100-300
- Multi-model validation strategy
- Cross-provider comparison (OpenAI + Google + optionally Anthropic)
- Ensemble voting research
- Complete 2,885-specimen deliverable + research insights
