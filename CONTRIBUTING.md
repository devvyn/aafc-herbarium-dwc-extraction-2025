# Contributing

Start by running `./bootstrap.sh` to install dependencies and run baseline checks. Follow the repository's guidelines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and run `ruff check . --fix` and `pytest` before submitting changes.

Review [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for development conventions and consult the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for open tasks and priorities.
