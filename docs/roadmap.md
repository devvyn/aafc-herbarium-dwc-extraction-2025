# Roadmap

Strategic priorities for the herbarium OCR to Darwin Core toolkit.

**Current development focus:** See [GitHub Projects](#project-organization) below for detailed progress tracking across the complete herbarium digitization ecosystem.

## Completed Research Contributions

- **‚úÖ Reproducible Image Access System** ‚Äî **Research Tool Development** (September 2025)
  - **Purpose**: Developed comprehensive system for reproducible herbarium image referencing to support digitization research
  - **Methodology**: Quality-stratified image categorization with realistic distributions matching institutional collections
  - **Impact**: Enables reproducible testing, collaborative research, and standardized benchmarking across institutions
  - **Components**: S3 integration, automated categorization, test bundle generation, public accessibility framework
  - **Academic Value**: Provides standardized research methodology for herbarium digitization quality assessment
  - **Documentation**: [REPRODUCIBLE_IMAGES_SUMMARY.md](../REPRODUCIBLE_IMAGES_SUMMARY.md)

## Immediate Priorities (2 Months Remaining)

**Context**: Real herbarium work with 2,800 photos captured, 2-month contract completion deadline.

### Phase 1: Maximize Existing Data Value (Weeks 1-2)
- **Process 2,800 captured photos** with current OCR toolkit
- **Generate review-ready datasets** for institutional delivery
- **Quality assessment** of OCR accuracy on real specimen data

### Phase 2: Successor Handover (Weeks 3-8)
- **Streamline review workflows** for efficient correction process
- **SharePoint integration** for institutional data transfer
- **Complete handover documentation** and training materials
- **Future-proof automation** for continued digitization

See [HANDOVER_PRIORITIES.md](HANDOVER_PRIORITIES.md) for detailed 8-week plan.

## Long-term Development Features

- **Integrate multilingual OCR models for non-English labels** ‚Äî Future priority ([#138](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/138))
- **Integrate GBIF taxonomy and locality verification into QC pipeline** ‚Äî Future priority ([#139](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/139))

## Issue Management

Create GitHub issues from roadmap entries:

```bash
python scripts/create_roadmap_issues.py --repo <owner>/<repo> \
    --project-owner <owner> --project-number <n>
```

This script keeps the roadmap synchronized with GitHub Projects for automated agent workflows.

## Medium Priority Features

- **Support GPU-accelerated inference for Tesseract** ‚Äî Q3 2025 ([#186](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/186))
- **Populate mapping rules** in `config/rules/dwc_rules.toml` and `config/rules/vocab.toml` ([#157](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/157))
- **Audit trail for import steps** with explicit user sign-off ([#193](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/193))
- **Add evaluation harness** for GPT prompt template coverage ([#195](https://github.com/devvyn/aafc-herbarium-dwc-extraction-2025/issues/195))

For a complete feature history, see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Project Organization

The AAFC herbarium digitization project spans multiple domains requiring coordinated development across several GitHub Projects:

### [üèóÔ∏è AAFC Herbarium Infrastructure](https://github.com/users/devvyn/projects/5)
**Focus**: Deployment, operations, and production workflows
- Import audit workflows and compliance
- Configuration management and deployment automation
- Production monitoring and system integration
- Multi-repository orchestration and CI/CD pipelines

### [üíª AAFC Herbarium Core Development](https://github.com/users/devvyn/projects/6)
**Focus**: Core toolkit features and technical enhancements
- OCR engine improvements (GPU acceleration, multilingual support)
- Schema parsing and mapping automation
- Development tooling and testing infrastructure
- Performance optimization and technical debt

### [üìä AAFC Herbarium Data & Research](https://github.com/users/devvyn/projects/7)
**Focus**: Data quality, analysis, and research workflows
- GBIF integration and taxonomic validation
- Geographic data verification and gazetteer services
- Export formats and reporting tools
- Research collaboration and data publication

### [üìã Legacy Project](https://github.com/users/devvyn/projects/4)
**Status**: Being reorganized into the new structure above

This multi-project structure supports the full scope of herbarium digitization beyond just code development, enabling coordinated progress across infrastructure deployment, research workflows, and institutional integration.
