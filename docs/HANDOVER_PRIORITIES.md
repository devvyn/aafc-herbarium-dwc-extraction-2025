# Handover Priorities - 2 Months Remaining

## Current Status
- **2,800 photos captured** from pressed plant specimens
- **Physical access**: Herbarium for specimens/equipment, camera, photography box
- **Network access**: Work network for email, SharePoint, Microsoft services
- **Original task**: Digitize specimens + create spreadsheet of labels/DAS numbers
- **Goal**: Maximize tools and workflows for successor

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Months)

### Phase 1: Process Existing Photos (Week 1-2)
**Objective**: Get maximum value from 2.8k photos already captured

1. **Bulk OCR Processing**
   - Run toolkit on all 2,800 images using fastest engines (Vision/Tesseract)
   - Generate initial CSV with extracted labels and confidence scores
   - Flag low-confidence results for manual review

2. **Quick Quality Assessment**
   - Sample 100-200 results to assess OCR accuracy
   - Identify common failure patterns
   - Document preprocessing needs (lighting, contrast, rotation)

### Phase 2: Streamline Review Workflow (Week 3-4)
**Objective**: Create efficient review process for successor

1. **Optimize Review Interface**
   - Set up web review interface for side-by-side image/text comparison
   - Configure batch approval workflows
   - Create shortcuts for common corrections (collector names, locations)

2. **Institutional Integration**
   - Export review-ready spreadsheets to SharePoint
   - Set up import/export workflows with Microsoft services
   - Document network connectivity requirements

### Phase 3: Knowledge Transfer Package (Week 5-6)
**Objective**: Complete handover documentation

1. **Successor Onboarding Guide**
   - Step-by-step processing workflow
   - Camera setup and photography best practices
   - Common troubleshooting scenarios
   - Network setup and SharePoint integration

2. **Institutional Deliverables**
   - Final processed dataset from 2.8k photos
   - Quality metrics and accuracy assessment
   - Recommended workflow for remaining specimens
   - Cost/time estimates for future work

### Phase 4: Future-Proofing (Week 7-8)
**Objective**: Set up successor for long-term success

1. **Automation Setup**
   - Configure batch processing scripts
   - Set up scheduled exports to institutional systems
   - Document maintenance and updates

2. **Expansion Planning**
   - Recommend hardware/software for scaling
   - Document integration with GBIF and other databases
   - Create roadmap for remaining collection digitization

## Key Deliverables for Successor

### Technical Package
- [ ] Fully processed dataset from 2,800 photos
- [ ] Working OCR + review workflow
- [ ] SharePoint integration scripts
- [ ] Installation and setup documentation

### Institutional Package
- [ ] Spreadsheet template with standardized fields
- [ ] Quality control procedures
- [ ] Network setup and security documentation
- [ ] Cost/benefit analysis for continued digitization

### Knowledge Package
- [ ] Photography best practices guide
- [ ] Common specimen types and OCR challenges
- [ ] Workflow optimization lessons learned
- [ ] Contact information for technical support

## Success Metrics
- **Data**: All 2,800 photos processed with quality scores
- **Workflow**: Successor can process 50+ specimens/day
- **Integration**: Seamless handoff to SharePoint/institutional systems
- **Sustainability**: Clear path for remaining collection digitization

## Risk Mitigation
- **Time constraints**: Focus on core workflow before advanced features
- **Technical complexity**: Emphasize documentation and training over optimization
- **Institutional continuity**: Package everything for offline operation if network access limited
