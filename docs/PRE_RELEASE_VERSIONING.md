# Pre-Release Versioning Guide

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04

## Overview

Pre-release identifiers (alpha, beta, rc) signal the maturity and stability of software before a stable release. This guide explains when to use each identifier and the criteria for progression.

## The Pre-Release Spectrum

```
Development ‚Üí alpha ‚Üí beta ‚Üí rc ‚Üí stable
   (private)    ‚Üì       ‚Üì      ‚Üì      ‚Üì
              Unstable  Testing  Final  Production
              Incomplete Complete Checks  Ready
```

## Alpha (Œ±) - Early Development

### What is Alpha?

**Alpha releases** are early, incomplete implementations where:
- Features are still being developed
- APIs may change dramatically
- Breaking changes are expected
- Internal testing is ongoing
- Not all planned features are implemented

### Characteristics

**Stability**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Unstable - expect bugs and crashes
**API Changes**: ‚úã Frequent breaking changes expected
**Features**: üöß Incomplete, under active development
**Testing**: üî¨ Limited internal testing
**Documentation**: üìù May be incomplete or outdated
**Audience**: üë®‚Äçüíª Developers and early adopters only

### When to Use Alpha

Use `alpha.N` when:
- ‚úÖ First working prototype exists
- ‚úÖ Core functionality partially implemented
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes expected in next iteration
- ‚úÖ Need feedback on approach/architecture
- ‚úÖ Not feature-complete yet

**Example Criteria**:
- 30-60% of planned features implemented
- Major features work but missing edge cases
- Known bugs and incomplete error handling
- Documentation exists but may be inaccurate

### Alpha Progression Rules

**Increment alpha.N** (e.g., alpha.1 ‚Üí alpha.2) when:
- Adding new incomplete features
- Making breaking changes to API
- Significant refactoring in progress
- Each development milestone reached

**Move to beta** when:
- All planned features implemented (even if buggy)
- API stabilized (no more breaking changes expected)
- Ready for wider testing
- Documentation reflects current state

### Example: Alpha Release Lifecycle

```
v1.0.0-alpha.1 - First working OCR pipeline
  ‚Üì Add Darwin Core extraction (incomplete)
v1.0.0-alpha.2 - Basic DWC extraction working
  ‚Üì Add GBIF validation (breaking API change)
v1.0.0-alpha.3 - GBIF integration complete
  ‚Üì All planned features now implemented
v1.0.0-beta.1 - Feature complete, begin testing
```

## Beta (Œ≤) - Feature Complete Testing

### What is Beta?

**Beta releases** are feature-complete implementations where:
- All planned features are implemented
- API is stabilized (no more breaking changes)
- Focus shifts to bug fixes and polish
- Ready for broader testing
- May still have known bugs

### Characteristics

**Stability**: ‚öôÔ∏è Mostly stable - bugs expected but not crashes
**API Changes**: üîí API frozen - only bug fixes, no breaking changes
**Features**: ‚úÖ Feature complete - all planned functionality present
**Testing**: üß™ Extensive testing in progress
**Documentation**: üìö Complete and accurate
**Audience**: üë• Early adopters and testers

### When to Use Beta

Use `beta.N` when:
- ‚úÖ All planned features implemented
- ‚úÖ API is stable (no breaking changes planned)
- ‚úÖ Core functionality works reliably
- ‚úÖ Known bugs being fixed
- ‚úÖ Documentation is complete
- ‚úÖ Ready for user testing

**Example Criteria**:
- 90%+ of features working correctly
- No critical bugs (P0/P1 issues resolved)
- Performance is acceptable
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Test coverage >80%

### Beta Progression Rules

**Increment beta.N** (e.g., beta.1 ‚Üí beta.2) when:
- Fixing bugs discovered during testing
- Adding minor polish/improvements (no new features)
- Improving documentation
- Performance optimizations

**Move to rc** when:
- No known critical or major bugs
- All tests passing consistently
- Documentation complete and reviewed
- Performance meets requirements
- Ready for final validation

### Example: Beta Release Lifecycle

```
v1.0.0-beta.1 - Feature complete, begin testing
  ‚Üì Fix 15 bugs found during testing
v1.0.0-beta.2 - Major bugs fixed, more testing
  ‚Üì Fix 8 more bugs, optimize performance
v1.0.0-beta.3 - Minor bugs fixed, stable
  ‚Üì Final testing - no new bugs found
v1.0.0-rc.1 - Release candidate
```

## RC (Release Candidate) - Final Validation

### What is RC?

**Release Candidates** are production-ready builds undergoing final validation:
- Believed to be stable enough for production
- No known critical bugs
- Only showstopper bugs will block release
- Final verification and stakeholder approval
- Next release could be stable (if no issues found)

### Characteristics

**Stability**: ‚úÖ Production-ready - should be stable
**API Changes**: üîí Frozen - absolutely no changes unless critical bug
**Features**: ‚úÖ Complete and polished
**Testing**: ‚úîÔ∏è Comprehensive testing complete
**Documentation**: üìñ Final, production-ready
**Audience**: üåç All users (production trial)

### When to Use RC

Use `rc.N` when:
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No known critical or major bugs
- ‚úÖ Performance validated
- ‚úÖ Security audit complete (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Documentation finalized
- ‚úÖ Stakeholder approval pending
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

**Example Criteria**:
- Zero known P0/P1 (critical/major) bugs
- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance benchmarks passed
- Code review complete
- Legal/compliance approved (if applicable)

### RC Progression Rules

**Increment rc.N** (e.g., rc.1 ‚Üí rc.2) when:
- Critical bug discovered during RC phase
- Only showstopper issues justify new RC
- Each fix creates new RC for re-validation

**Move to stable** when:
- RC deployed to production successfully
- No critical issues found after soak period (e.g., 1-2 weeks)
- Stakeholder sign-off received
- Final approval checklist complete

### Example: RC Release Lifecycle

```
v1.0.0-rc.1 - Release candidate
  ‚Üì Deploy to staging, test for 1 week
  ‚Üì Critical bug found in edge case
v1.0.0-rc.2 - Bug fixed, re-test
  ‚Üì Deploy to staging, test for 1 week
  ‚Üì No issues found, stakeholder approval
v1.0.0 - Stable production release
```

## Decision Framework

**If >3 checked ‚Üí Use alpha.N**

#### Beta Checklist
- [ ] All planned features implemented
- [ ] API stabilized (no breaking changes)
- [ ] Core functionality working
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for user testing

**If >4 checked ‚Üí Use beta.N**

#### RC Checklist
- [ ] All features complete and polished
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval pending

**If all checked ‚Üí Use rc.N**

#### Stable Checklist
- [ ] RC deployed successfully
- [ ] No critical issues in production
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off received
- [ ] Soak period complete

**If all checked ‚Üí Release as stable MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

### Quality Gates

Each progression requires passing quality gates:

```
alpha ‚Üí beta: Feature Completeness Gate
  ‚úÖ All planned features implemented
  ‚úÖ API stabilized
  ‚úÖ Documentation complete

beta ‚Üí rc: Quality Gate
  ‚úÖ No critical/major bugs
  ‚úÖ All tests passing
  ‚úÖ Performance acceptable

rc ‚Üí stable: Production Gate
  ‚úÖ Production validation successful
  ‚úÖ No showstoppers found
  ‚úÖ Stakeholder approval
```

## Timeline Guidelines

### Development Velocity

**Alpha Phase**: Days to weeks per increment
- Rapid iteration
- Frequent releases (daily/weekly)
- Quick feedback loops

**Beta Phase**: Weeks per increment
- Slower, more deliberate
- Weekly/biweekly releases
- Thorough testing between releases

**RC Phase**: Weeks per increment
- Careful validation
- Minimal changes
- Production-like testing

### Typical Durations

**Alpha ‚Üí Beta**: 1-3 months
- Depends on feature scope
- Multiple alpha releases expected

**Beta ‚Üí RC**: 2-6 weeks
- Bug fixing and polishing
- 2-4 beta releases typical

**RC ‚Üí Stable**: 1-3 weeks
- Final validation
- 1-2 RC releases typical (ideally 1)

## Numbering Schemes

### Sequential Numbering (Recommended)

```
v1.0.0-alpha.1
v1.0.0-alpha.2
v1.0.0-alpha.3
v1.0.0-beta.1
v1.0.0-beta.2
v1.0.0-rc.1
v1.0.0
```

**Advantages**:
- Clear progression
- Easy to compare versions
- Standard semantic versioning

### Date-Based Numbering

```
v1.0.0-alpha.20251001
v1.0.0-alpha.20251015
v1.0.0-beta.20251101
v1.0.0-rc.20251201
v1.0.0
```

**Use when**:
- Rapid iteration (multiple per day)
- Need to track exact build date
- CI/CD automated releases

### Named Alphas (Avoid)

```
v1.0.0-alpha-storage
v1.0.0-alpha-ui
v1.0.0-beta-final
```

**Why avoid**:
- Not sortable
- Confusing progression
- Breaks semantic versioning

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

**Version Progression**:
- ‚úÖ Always increment pre-release identifier when making changes
- ‚úÖ Follow alpha ‚Üí beta ‚Üí rc ‚Üí stable progression
- ‚úÖ Document what changed between pre-releases
- ‚úÖ Announce pre-releases with clear warnings

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Increase test rigor at each stage (alpha ‚Üí beta ‚Üí rc)
- ‚úÖ Beta testing should include real users
- ‚úÖ RC testing should simulate production

**Communication**:
- ‚úÖ Clear labels (ALPHA, BETA, RC) in all communications
- ‚úÖ List known issues and limitations
- ‚úÖ Explain what feedback you're seeking

### DON'T ‚ùå

**Version Management**:
- ‚ùå Skip stages (alpha ‚Üí rc without beta)
- ‚ùå Add features during RC phase
- ‚ùå Release stable if RC had critical bugs
- ‚ùå Reuse pre-release numbers (no v1.0.0-beta.1 twice)

**Testing**:
- ‚ùå Skip testing phases to ship faster
- ‚ùå Promote to next stage without meeting criteria
- ‚ùå Release RC with known critical bugs

**Communication**:
- ‚ùå Call alpha releases "beta" (sets wrong expectations)
- ‚ùå Promote pre-releases without clear warnings
- ‚ùå Hide known issues from users

## Example: AAFC Herbarium Project

### Current State Analysis

**v1.0.0-beta.1** (Current latest tag):
- Full dataset extraction working ‚úÖ
- OCR pipeline complete ‚úÖ
- Darwin Core export functional ‚úÖ
- Some architectural improvements in progress üöß

**Storage Abstraction (Latest commit)**:
- New architecture implemented ‚úÖ
- Backward compatible (no breaking changes) ‚úÖ
- 18 tests passing ‚úÖ
- Documentation complete ‚úÖ
- CLI integration deferred (not feature-incomplete) ‚úÖ

### Recommendation: v1.0.0-beta.2

**Why beta (not rc)?**
- ‚úÖ Feature complete - All extraction features working
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible - Existing workflows unaffected
- ‚úÖ Well tested - 18 new tests passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not quite ready for production validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More architectural work may come
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need user testing of new features

**Why not rc?**
- No production deployment/validation yet
- Additional features may be added before 1.0.0
- Stakeholder validation not complete
- Soak testing not performed

**Why not alpha?**
- Not breaking changes (backward compatible)
- Feature is complete (Phase 1 done)
- API is stable (ImageLocator protocol finalized)
- Well tested and documented
