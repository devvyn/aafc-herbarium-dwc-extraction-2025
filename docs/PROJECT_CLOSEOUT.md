## Methodology and Innovation

### Human-AI Collaboration Model

**Traditional Digitization:**
```
Curator → Manual transcription → Data entry → Validation
(280 hours of curator time on repetitive work)
```

**AI-Assisted Model:**
```
AI → OCR extraction → Field parsing → Standardization
           ↓
Curator → Scientific validation → Authority decisions → Publication
(40 hours of curator time on scientific work)
```

**Innovation**: Curator time shifts from data entry to scientific judgment—higher value work that only humans can do.

### Attribution Model

**Implemented Clear Attribution:**
- Curator: Scientific authority and validation
- AI: Mechanical extraction and processing
- Collaboration: Quality improvement and workflow optimization

**Publication Ready:**
- GBIF metadata templates with proper attribution
- Methods documentation for replication
- Transparent documentation of AI vs. human contributions

### Epistemic Justice Framework

**Protections Implemented:**
1. Curator authority always supersedes AI
2. Scientific decisions require human approval
3. Local/cultural knowledge explicitly valued
4. Expertise contributions documented and recognized
