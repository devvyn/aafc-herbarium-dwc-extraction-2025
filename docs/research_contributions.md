## üéØ Major Research Contribution: Reproducible Image Access System

### **Research Context and Motivation**

#### **Problem Statement**
Herbarium digitization research lacks standardized, reproducible testing methodologies that enable:
- Consistent quality assessment across different OCR and AI processing systems
- Collaborative research with shared, accessible test datasets

#### **Research Gap Identified**
Existing herbarium digitization efforts typically use:
- Ad-hoc, institution-specific test images
- Inconsistent quality categories and performance metrics
- Non-reproducible testing methodologies
- Limited accessibility for collaborative research

### **Methodological Innovation**

#### **Quality Stratification Framework**

| **Minimal Text** | 25% | Readable elements, moderate quality | OCR system evaluation |
| **Unlabeled Specimens** | 20% | Specimen-only images | Edge case handling assessment |
| **Poor Quality** | 15% | Challenging conditions | Robustness testing |
| **Multilingual** | Variable | Non-English labels | Language processing evaluation |

**Research Methodology**: Distribution percentages derived from analysis of institutional herbarium collection characteristics, providing realistic test scenarios for research validation.
