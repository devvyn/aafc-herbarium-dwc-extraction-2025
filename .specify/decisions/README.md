# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made during the development of the AAFC Herbarium DWC Extraction system.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document the key architectural decisions made during a project's lifecycle. They capture:
- The context that led to the decision
- The options that were considered
- The decision that was made and why
- The consequences of that decision

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect the software architecture
- Are significant in cost or time
- Impact multiple system components
- Introduce new technologies or dependencies
- Establish patterns for future development
- Have long-term consequences

## ADR Lifecycle

ADRs follow this lifecycle:
1. **Proposed** - Initial draft, seeking feedback
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and being implemented
3. **Deprecated** - No longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer decision (link to replacement)

## Naming Convention

ADRs are named: `adr-NNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`

Examples:
- `adr-001-ocr-engine-selection.md`
- `adr-002-database-technology-choice.md`
- `adr-003-api-authentication-strategy.md`

## Current ADR Index

### Technology Decisions
- [ADR-001: OCR Engine Selection Strategy](adr-001-ocr-engine-selection-strategy.md) - *Status: Accepted*
- [ADR-002: Configuration Management Approach](adr-002-configuration-management-approach.md) - *Status: Accepted*

### Architecture Decisions
- [ADR-003: Pipeline Processing Architecture](adr-003-pipeline-processing-architecture.md) - *Status: Accepted*
- [ADR-004: Review System Multi-Interface Strategy](adr-004-review-system-multi-interface-strategy.md) - *Status: Accepted*

### Integration Decisions
- [ADR-005: GBIF API Integration Strategy](adr-005-gbif-api-integration-strategy.md) - *Status: Accepted*

*Note: These ADRs are reverse-engineered from existing implementation decisions. Future ADRs should be created before implementation.*

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp .specify/templates/architecture-decision-record.md .specify/decisions/adr-XXX-your-decision.md
   ```

2. **Assign the next number** by checking the current index above

3. **Complete all sections** of the template

4. **Review with stakeholders** before marking as "Accepted"

5. **Update this index** with the new ADR

6. **Reference in implementation** commits and PRs

## ADR Review Process

### For New ADRs
1. **Draft Creation** - Create ADR with status "Proposed"
2. **Stakeholder Review** - Share with relevant team members
3. **Discussion Period** - Allow time for feedback and alternatives
4. **Decision** - Update status to "Accepted" when approved
5. **Implementation** - Reference ADR in implementation work

### For Existing ADRs
- **Regular Review** - Periodically assess if decisions are still valid
- **Status Updates** - Update status when decisions change
- **Lessons Learned** - Document outcomes and lessons in consequences section

## Integration with Development Workflow

### During Planning
- Check existing ADRs for relevant decisions
- Create new ADRs for architectural choices
- Ensure decisions align with project constitution

### During Implementation
- Reference relevant ADRs in commits and PRs
- Update ADRs if implementation reveals new information
- Create new ADRs if significant decisions emerge

### During Review
- Validate that implementations follow documented decisions
- Check if new architectural patterns need ADR documentation
- Ensure ADR status remains current

## Common Decision Categories

### Technology Choices
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Databases and storage systems
- External services and APIs
- Development tools and libraries

### Architecture Patterns
- System decomposition strategies
- Communication patterns between components
- Data flow and storage patterns
- Security and authentication approaches

### Process Decisions
- Deployment and delivery strategies
- Testing and quality assurance approaches
- Monitoring and observability strategies
- Documentation and knowledge management

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs
- **Be Specific**: Focus on architectural decisions, not implementation details
- **Be Honest**: Document trade-offs and limitations, not just benefits
- **Be Complete**: Include sufficient context for future readers
- **Be Timely**: Create ADRs when decisions are made, not after

### Maintaining ADRs
- **Keep Updated**: Update status and consequences as they become apparent
- **Link Related ADRs**: Reference decisions that build on or supersede others
- **Archive Old Decisions**: Mark superseded ADRs but don't delete them
- **Learn from History**: Use ADR outcomes to improve future decision making

### Team Adoption
- **Make Visible**: Reference ADRs in planning and review meetings
- **Make Accessible**: Ensure all team members can find and read ADRs
- **Make Relevant**: Focus on decisions that actually matter to the team
- **Make Iterative**: Improve the ADR process based on team feedback

## Success Metrics

### Decision Quality
- **Fewer Surprises**: Reduced unexpected consequences from architectural decisions
- **Better Context**: New team members can understand historical decisions
- **Improved Consistency**: Similar decisions made consistently across the project

### Process Effectiveness
- **Regular Usage**: ADRs are created for significant decisions
- **Team Engagement**: ADRs are referenced in planning and implementation
- **Living Documentation**: ADRs are updated as consequences become apparent

---

*Remember: ADRs are not just documentation - they're tools for improving decision making and team communication. Focus on decisions that matter and keep records that help the team succeed.*
