# ADR-001: OCR Engine Selection Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-25 (Reverse-Engineered from v0.3.0 Implementation)
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team, Research Analysis
**Technical Story**: Comprehensive OCR engine analysis revealing Apple Vision 95% accuracy vs Tesseract 15%

## Context and Problem Statement

The herbarium digitization system required highly accurate OCR capabilities to extract text from specimen labels with minimal manual correction. Initial implementation used Tesseract as the primary OCR engine, but accuracy was insufficient for production use.

### Current Situation
- Tesseract OCR achieving only 15% accuracy on herbarium specimens
- High manual correction burden (95% of specimens requiring review)
- Institutional need for cost-effective processing of 2,800 specimen collection
- Production deployment timeline constraints

### Requirements
- **Accuracy**: >90% character recognition on herbarium specimen labels
- **Cost**: Minimize ongoing operational costs for large-scale processing
- **Reliability**: Robust fallback strategies for processing continuity
- **Performance**: Target 4-hour processing for 2,800 specimens

## Decision Drivers

- **Accuracy**: Primary driver - need to minimize manual curation burden
- **Cost Management**: Zero marginal cost preferred for primary processing
- **Platform Constraints**: macOS development environment available
- **Research Evidence**: Comprehensive testing of 7 OCR engines completed
- **Production Timeline**: Need immediate deployment capability

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Continue with Tesseract
**Description**: Maintain Tesseract as primary engine with parameter tuning
**Pros**:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No API costs
- Existing integration

**Cons**:
- Only 15% accuracy confirmed through testing
- High manual correction burden
- Poor ROI for institutional processing

**Cost/Effort**: Low implementation, high operational cost
**Risk**: High - insufficient accuracy for production use

### Option 2: Cloud API Primary (Google/Azure/AWS)
**Description**: Use cloud vision APIs as primary processing engine
**Pros**:
- Better accuracy than Tesseract
- Cross-platform capability
- Professional support

**Cons**:
- $1-1.50 per 1000 images ongoing cost
- API dependency and rate limits
- Requires internet connectivity

**Cost/Effort**: Medium implementation, ongoing operational costs
**Risk**: Medium - cost accumulation and service dependency

### Option 3: Apple Vision Primary with Cloud Fallbacks
**Description**: Use Apple Vision as primary with cloud APIs as fallbacks
**Pros**:
- 95% accuracy validated on real specimens
- Zero marginal cost for primary processing
- Robust fallback strategy
- Native macOS integration

**Cons**:
- macOS platform dependency
- Limited to Apple ecosystem
- Fallback complexity

**Cost/Effort**: Medium implementation, minimal operational cost
**Risk**: Low - exceptional accuracy with cost control

### Option 4: Premium AI Vision APIs (Claude/GPT-4)
**Description**: Use premium AI vision models as primary engine
**Pros**:
- Potentially highest accuracy
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Structured output support

**Cons**:
- Very high cost ($15-50 per 1000 images)
- API rate limits and dependencies
- Overkill for OCR-only tasks

**Cost/Effort**: Medium implementation, very high operational cost
**Risk**: High - cost prohibitive for large-scale processing

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Apple Vision Primary with Cloud Fallbacks (Option 3)

**Rationale**:
- Research demonstrated 95% accuracy vs 15% for Tesseract
- Zero marginal cost enables processing of entire 2,800 specimen collection
- Robust fallback strategy maintains processing continuity
- Immediate deployment capability meets production timeline
- Cost savings of $1600+ compared to manual transcription

### Implementation Plan
1. Integrate Apple Vision as preferred OCR engine
2. Implement cloud API fallback chain (Google → Azure → Claude → GPT)
3. Add platform detection and graceful degradation
4. Update configuration defaults to reflect new priority
5. Retire Tesseract as primary recommendation

### Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Achieve >90% character recognition (Target: 95%)
- **Cost**: Process 2,800 specimens with <$500 total OCR costs
- **Performance**: Complete collection processing in <8 hours
- **Reliability**: <1% processing failures requiring manual intervention

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Dramatic Accuracy Improvement**: 95% vs 15% reduces manual work by 85%
- **Cost Control**: Zero marginal cost for 95% of processing
- **Production Viability**: Enables institutional deployment at scale
- **Research Value**: Establishes evidence-based OCR best practices

### Negative Consequences
- **Platform Dependency**: Primary processing requires macOS environment
- **Architectural Complexity**: Multi-engine fallback increases system complexity
- **Cross-Platform Limitations**: Windows/Linux users depend on cloud APIs

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback Strategy**: Comprehensive cloud API chain prevents processing failure
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track fallback usage to prevent surprise costs
- **Platform Planning**: Document non-macOS deployment strategies
- **Performance Testing**: Validate processing speed meets institutional needs

## Implementation Details

### Technical Changes Required
- Update engine priority configuration: Apple Vision first
- Implement platform detection logic for engine selection
- Add cost tracking and monitoring for fallback usage
- Update documentation and deployment guides

### Dependencies
- **macOS Environment**: Required for Apple Vision processing
- **Cloud API Keys**: Backup processing capabilities
- **Configuration Updates**: Engine priority and fallback thresholds

### Migration Strategy
- **Immediate**: Update default configuration to prioritize Apple Vision
- **Graceful**: Maintain Tesseract support for legacy compatibility
- **Monitored**: Track usage patterns and accuracy improvements

## Validation and Testing

### Validation Plan
- **Accuracy Testing**: Process sample collection and measure character recognition
- **Performance Testing**: Time full collection processing workflow
- **Cost Analysis**: Track actual vs projected processing costs
- **Reliability Testing**: Validate fallback behavior under various failure scenarios

### Monitoring
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Track character recognition rates by engine
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor cloud API usage and associated costs
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure processing throughput and latency
- **Error Rates**: Track processing failures and fallback triggers

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] Implement Apple Vision as preferred engine
- [x] Update default configuration files
- [x] Document deployment requirements for macOS
- [ ] Create cross-platform deployment guide for cloud-only scenarios
- [ ] Establish monitoring dashboard for processing metrics
- [ ] Plan periodic accuracy validation on new specimen types
