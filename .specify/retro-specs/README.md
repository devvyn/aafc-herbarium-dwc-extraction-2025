# Retroactive Specifications

This directory contains reverse-engineered specifications for major features developed before the systematic specification process was established.

## Purpose

These retroactive specifications serve to:
- **Document critical design decisions** made during development
- **Identify missing requirements** that should have been specified upfront
- **Extract lessons learned** for future development
- **Establish patterns** for effective specification writing
- **Provide context** for future maintenance and enhancement

## Completed Retroactive Specifications

### `apple-vision-ocr-integration.md`
**Feature**: Apple Vision OCR Integration (v0.3.0)
**Impact**: Production-critical 95% accuracy breakthrough
**Key Lessons**:
- Research-driven development approach worked well
- Missing cross-platform compatibility planning
- Abrupt technology migration without documented strategy

### `modern-ui-system.md`
**Feature**: Modern UI/UX System (Current)
**Impact**: Complete interface transformation with multiple UI options
**Key Lessons**:
- Multi-interface strategy serves diverse user needs
- Missing user research and accessibility planning
- Architecture decisions need better documentation

### `dwc-archive-export-system.md`
**Feature**: Darwin Core Archive Export System (v0.2.0)
**Impact**: Institutional compliance and versioned data exports
**Key Lessons**:
- Standards compliance approach was effective
- Performance and storage planning missing
- Migration strategy for format changes needed

## Process Documentation

### `specification-checkpoint-strategy.md`
**Purpose**: Establish systematic specification practices going forward
**Content**:
- Mandatory specification checkpoints
- Quality gates and validation criteria
- Specification debt management strategy
- Success metrics and implementation plan

## Using These Specifications

### For Current Development
- **Reference patterns** when creating new specifications
- **Avoid documented pitfalls** from lessons learned
- **Apply decision frameworks** established in retro analysis

### For Future Enhancements
- **Understand context** behind existing architecture decisions
- **Identify improvement opportunities** based on missing requirements
- **Plan migrations** using documented current state

### For Team Onboarding
- **Study major features** and their development rationale
- **Learn specification best practices** from real examples
- **Understand project evolution** and decision history

## Specification Debt

### High Priority Features Needing Retro-Specs
1. **GBIF Integration System** - Complex external API dependency
2. **Processing Pipeline Configuration** - Affects all workflows
3. **Quality Control Review System** - User-facing critical workflows

### Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Work
**All Priority 1 retroactive specifications completed**:
- Apple Vision OCR Integration (production-critical accuracy breakthrough)
- Modern UI/UX System (complete interface transformation)
- Darwin Core Archive Export (institutional compliance system)
- GBIF Integration System (external API dependency)
- Processing Pipeline Configuration (affects all workflows)
- Quality Control Review System (user-facing critical workflows)

**Specification infrastructure established**:
- Comprehensive template system in `.specify/templates/`
- Decision log framework in `.specify/decisions/`
- Updated development workflow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Implementation roadmap in `.specify/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Begin using specification checkpoints for all new development
2. **Short-term**: Create specifications for remaining Priority 2-3 features
3. **Ongoing**: Maintain specification quality through regular reviews
4. **Long-term**: Use lessons learned to improve specification framework

## Template Reference

When creating new retroactive specifications, follow this structure:

```markdown
# Retroactive Specification: [Feature Name]

**Feature ID**: retro-XXX-feature-name
**Development Phase**: [Version/Phase]
**Implementation Date**: [Date]
**Source Commit**: [Commit hash and message]

## Reverse-Engineered Requirements
### Background Context
### User Stories (Inferred)
### Functional Requirements (Reverse-Engineered)
### Technical Implementation (From Code Analysis)
### Success Criteria (Observed)
### Quality Attributes
