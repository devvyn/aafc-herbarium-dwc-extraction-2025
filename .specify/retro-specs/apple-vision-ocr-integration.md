# Retroactive Specification: Apple Vision OCR Integration

**Feature ID**: `retro-001-apple-vision-ocr`
**Development Phase**: v0.3.0 (OCR Research Breakthrough)
**Implementation Date**: September 25, 2025
**Source Commit**: `00409cb` - "üèóÔ∏è Apple Vision-first architecture - Retire Tesseract"

## Reverse-Engineered Requirements

### Background Context
Based on commit history and research documentation, this feature emerged from comprehensive OCR engine analysis that revealed Apple Vision's superior performance (95% accuracy vs Tesseract's 15%) on herbarium specimens.

### User Stories (Inferred)
- **As a herbarium curator**, I need highly accurate OCR to minimize manual correction work
- **As a research institution**, I need zero-cost OCR processing to handle large collections economically
- **As a production system**, I need reliable OCR without external API dependencies

### Functional Requirements (Reverse-Engineered)
1. **Primary OCR Engine**: Apple Vision replaces Tesseract as default
2. **Accuracy Target**: ‚â•95% character recognition on herbarium specimen labels
3. **Platform Support**: macOS native processing (no cross-platform initially)
4. **API Independence**: Zero external API costs for primary processing
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when Apple Vision unavailable

### Technical Implementation (From Code Analysis)
- **Engine Registration**: Integration with existing engine dispatch system
- **Swift Bridge**: Native macOS API calls through vision_swift module
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback to secondary OCR engines
- **Performance**: Target 4-hour processing for 2,800 specimens

### Success Criteria (Observed)
- ‚úÖ 95% accuracy validated on real AAFC specimen collection
- ‚úÖ Zero marginal processing costs
- ‚úÖ Production deployment capability
- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with existing pipeline

### Quality Attributes
- **Accuracy**: 95% character recognition rate
- **Performance**: ~5 seconds per specimen image
- **Reliability**: Graceful fallback to backup OCR engines
- **Cost**: Zero API fees for primary processing path

### Decisions Made (Inferred from Commits)
- **Architecture**: "Apple Vision-first" approach
- **Tesseract Role**: Retired as primary, kept as fallback
- **Platform Strategy**: macOS-first, expand later if needed
- **Integration**: Minimal changes to existing pipeline

## Lessons for Future Specifications

### What Worked Well
- **Research-Driven**: Comprehensive testing before implementation
- **Performance Focus**: Clear accuracy and cost targets
- **Pragmatic Approach**: Retired inferior technology decisively

### Missing from Original Development
- **Formal Specification**: No upfront requirements document
- **Cross-Platform Plan**: No strategy for non-macOS environments
- **Migration Path**: Abrupt transition from Tesseract

### Recommendation for Similar Features
1. **Create specification before implementation** (use `/specify`)
2. **Document architecture decisions explicitly**
3. **Plan migration strategy for breaking changes**
4. **Establish formal testing criteria upfront**
