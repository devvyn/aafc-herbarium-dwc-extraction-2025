# Specification Checkpoint Strategy for AAFC Herbarium Project

**Document Type**: Process Definition
**Created**: September 29, 2025
**Purpose**: Establish systematic specification practices going forward

## Retroactive Analysis Summary

### Major Features Reverse-Engineered
1. **Apple Vision OCR Integration** (v0.3.0) - Production-critical accuracy breakthrough
2. **Modern UI/UX System** (Current) - Complete interface transformation
3. **Darwin Core Archive Export** (v0.2.0) - Institutional compliance system

### Key Findings from Retroactive Analysis

#### What Worked Without Specifications
- **Research-Driven Development**: OCR breakthrough based on comprehensive testing
- **User-Centric Design**: Multiple UI interfaces serve different stakeholder needs
- **Standards Compliance**: Darwin Core Archive format adherence

#### What Suffered Without Specifications
- **Architecture Decisions**: Limited documentation of design choices and alternatives
- **Performance Requirements**: Missing concrete targets and testing criteria
- **Migration Planning**: Abrupt transitions without documented upgrade paths
- **Integration Complexity**: Undocumented coupling between system components

## Future Specification Checkpoints

### Mandatory Specification Points

#### 1. **Major Feature Development**
**Trigger**: Any feature requiring >3 days development effort
**Required Process**:
```bash
/specify <feature description>
/clarify  # Resolve critical ambiguities
/plan     # Technical design
/analyze  # Consistency check
```

#### 2. **Architecture Changes**
**Trigger**: Changes affecting >2 modules or external dependencies
**Required Analysis**:
- **Alternative Evaluation**: Document options considered and rejected
- **Performance Impact**: Concrete metrics and testing strategy
- **Migration Path**: Step-by-step upgrade strategy for existing systems
- **Integration Effects**: Impact on existing components and workflows

#### 3. **Production Dependencies**
**Trigger**: New external services, APIs, or critical libraries
**Required Documentation**:
- **Reliability Requirements**: Uptime, error rates, fallback strategies
- **Cost Analysis**: Ongoing operational costs and scaling implications
- **Vendor Risk**: Lock-in assessment and exit strategy
- **Compliance**: Security, privacy, and regulatory implications

#### 4. **Data Format Changes**
**Trigger**: Changes to exports, imports, or database schema
**Required Planning**:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy format support strategy
- **Migration Tools**: Automated conversion utilities
- **Validation Testing**: Compliance verification procedures
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Downstream system effects

### Specification Templates

#### Quick Feature Assessment
For smaller features, use this rapid assessment:
```markdown
## Feature: [Name]
**Effort**: [< 1 day | 1-3 days | > 3 days]
**Scope**: [Single module | Cross-module | Architecture]
**Risk**: [Low | Medium | High]

If Effort > 3 days OR Scope = Cross-module OR Risk = High:
â†’ Full specification required (/specify workflow)

Otherwise: Document in commit message with:
- **Purpose**: What problem this solves
- **Approach**: How it's implemented
- **Testing**: How it's validated
```

#### Critical Decision Documentation
For architecture decisions, always document:
```markdown
## Decision: [Title]
**Context**: What situation requires this decision?
**Options**: What alternatives were considered?
**Choice**: What was decided and why?
**Consequences**: What are the implications?
**Validation**: How will we know if this was right?
```

### Integration with Existing Workflow

#### Git Workflow Enhancement
- **Feature Branches**: All specified features use dedicated branches
- **Commit Messages**: Include specification references
- **PR Reviews**: Check for specification compliance
- **Release Notes**: Reference specifications in changelog

#### Documentation Integration
- **Retro-Specs**: Maintain `.specify/retro-specs/` for historical analysis
- **Active Specs**: Use `.specify/features/` for current development
- **Decision Log**: Track architecture decisions in `.specify/decisions/`

### Quality Gates

#### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Specification exists and approved
- [ ] Critical ambiguities resolved via `/clarify`
- [ ] Technical plan validated via `/analyze`
- [ ] Performance requirements defined

#### During Implementation
- [ ] Code follows specified architecture
- [ ] Tests validate specified requirements
- [ ] Performance meets specified targets
- [ ] Documentation updated with implementation details

#### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Specification updated with actual implementation
- [ ] Lessons learned documented
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded
- [ ] Future enhancement opportunities noted

## Specification Debt Management

### Existing Features Needing Specs
**Priority 1 (Critical)**:
- GBIF Integration System (complex external API dependency)
- Processing Pipeline Configuration (affects all workflows)
- Quality Control Review System (user-facing critical workflows)

**Priority 2 (Important)**:
- Schema Management System (affects data compliance)
- Preprocessing Pipeline (affects OCR accuracy)
- Multi-Engine OCR Dispatch (affects processing flexibility)

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have)**:
- Error Handling Strategy (cross-cutting concern)
- Logging and Monitoring (operational concern)
- Configuration Management (developer experience)

### Debt Reduction Strategy
1. **Create retro-specs for Priority 1 features** before next major release
2. **Document critical decisions** as they're encountered during development
3. **Require specs for new features** immediately
4. **Gradual documentation** of Priority 2-3 features during maintenance

## Success Metrics

### Specification Quality Indicators
- **Completeness**: No major features without specifications
- **Accuracy**: Specifications match actual implementation
- **Usability**: New developers can understand system from specs
- **Decision Traceability**: All architecture decisions documented

### Development Quality Improvements
- **Reduced Rework**: Fewer post-implementation architecture changes
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members productive faster
- **Better Planning**: More accurate effort estimates
- **Improved Quality**: Fewer production issues from unclear requirements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
- [x] Create retroactive specifications for 3 major features
- [x] Establish specification checkpoint strategy
- [ ] Document 3 Priority 1 features
- [ ] Update development documentation with new requirements

### Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Create specification templates in `.specify/templates/`
- [ ] Update git workflow documentation
- [ ] Train team on new specification process
- [ ] Begin requiring specs for all new features

### Phase 3 (Ongoing)
- [ ] Gradually document Priority 2-3 existing features
- [ ] Refine specification process based on experience
- [ ] Maintain decision log and lessons learned
- [ ] Regular retrospectives on specification effectiveness
