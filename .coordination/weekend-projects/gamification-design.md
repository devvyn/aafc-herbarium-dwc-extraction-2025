# Specimen Review Gamification

**Type**: Weekend Project / Collective Interest
**Status**: 💡 Design Phase
**Goal**: Make reviewing 2,885 specimens more engaging and fun

## The Problem

Reviewing thousands of herbarium specimens is:
- ⏱️ Tedious and repetitive
- 😴 Easy to lose motivation
- 📊 Hard to track progress
- 🤝 Isolating (solo work)

**Current stats**: 2,885 specimens need review. At 10/hour, that's 288 hours of work!

## Core Metaphor: Growing Toward Perfection

**Inspired by**: Barkour's multimodal game design (vertical progression, collecting rewards, reaching for the sky)

**Applied to specimen review**:
- 🌱 **Instead of**: Dog collecting bacon and jumping high into clouds
- 🔬 **We have**: Curator refining data quality and growing toward dataset perfection

**Core mechanic**: Each review action = data refinement step = vertical growth toward completeness

### Vertical Progression Visualization

```
      ⭐ 100% Perfect Dataset (asymptotic goal)
      │
  95% ├─────── 🏆 "Near Perfection" (unlocked badges)
      │
  85% ├─────── ✨ "High Quality" milestone
      │
  70% ├─────── 📈 "Good Progress" checkpoint
      │
  50% ├─────── 🌿 "Growing Strong"
      │
  25% ├─────── 🌱 "Taking Root"
      │
   0% └─────── 🌰 "Starting Point"

Your current height: 68% (approaching "Good Progress" → "High Quality")
```

**Each review improves**:
1. **Completeness**: % of specimens reviewed (vertical climb)
2. **Quality**: Average data accuracy across dataset (refinement)
3. **Confidence**: GBIF validation rate, correction accuracy (mastery)

**Visual feedback**:
- Progress bar grows UPWARD (like a plant/tree/tower)
- Colors transition from earth tones → vibrant greens → golden perfect
- Milestones unlock visual "stages" (seedling → sapling → tree → flowering)

**Gamification twist**:
- You're not just "completing tasks"
- You're "cultivating a perfect dataset"
- Each specimen is a step toward scientific excellence

## Spaced Repetition: Training Human Sensory Accuracy

**Key insight**: Reviewing specimens isn't just data entry—it's expertise building!

**How it works**:
1. **First exposure**: New specimen type (e.g., Asteraceae family)
2. **Recognition challenge**: Similar specimen appears 1 day later
3. **Reinforcement**: Related specimen appears 3 days later
4. **Mastery**: Challenging variation appears 7 days later

**Benefits**:
- Improve taxonomic recognition speed
- Build pattern recognition for OCR errors
- Train eye for quality assessment
- Develop domain expertise naturally

### Spaced Repetition System Design

**Concept**: The review queue adaptively shows specimens to maximize learning

```python
class SpacedRepetitionQueue:
    """Optimize specimen ordering for learning AND throughput"""

    def get_next_specimen(self, reviewer_stats):
        # Mix priorities:
        # 1. Critical specimens (business need)
        # 2. Learning opportunities (spaced repetition)
        # 3. Variety (prevent boredom)

        if needs_reinforcement(reviewer_stats):
            # Show similar specimen to reinforce learning
            return get_similar_to_recent(days_ago=1, 3, or 7)

        elif needs_challenge(reviewer_stats):
            # Test mastery with edge case
            return get_challenging_specimen()

        else:
            # Regular work queue
            return get_next_by_priority()
```

**Learning milestones tracked**:
- 🧠 **Pattern Recognition**: "You've correctly identified 10 Asteraceae specimens"
- 👁️ **Quality Eye**: "Your quality assessments are 95% aligned with GBIF"
- ⚡ **Speed Mastery**: "You're 2x faster at reviewing familiar families"
- 🎯 **Accuracy Growth**: "Your correction suggestions have 98% acceptance rate"

**Badges for learning progress**:
- 🌱 "Taxonomic Novice" - First exposure to family
- 🌿 "Family Familiar" - 10 specimens from same family reviewed
- 🌳 "Family Expert" - 50 specimens, 95%+ accuracy maintained
- 🏆 "Domain Master" - Expert level across 5+ families

**Spaced repetition benefits**:
1. **For reviewer**: Builds genuine expertise, not just task completion
2. **For dataset**: Higher quality reviews as skill improves
3. **For science**: Curators develop deep taxonomic knowledge
4. **For engagement**: Learning feels meaningful, not repetitive

### Integration with Vertical Growth

**The perfect combination**:
- **Vertical growth** = Dataset quality improving (collective progress)
- **Spaced repetition** = Reviewer skill improving (personal mastery)
- **Together** = Both the data AND the human get better over time!

**Visual representation**:
```
Dataset Quality (Vertical)          Reviewer Skill (Personal)

  100% ⭐ Perfect                    🏆 Domain Master
       │                                 │
   85% ├───── High Quality          ✨ Family Expert
       │                                 │
   70% ├───── Good Progress         🌿 Family Familiar
       │                                 │
    0% └───── Starting               🌱 Taxonomic Novice

Both grow together through review!
```

## Gamification Ideas

## The Synthesis: Barkour Principles + Data Refinement + Spaced Repetition

**What makes this gamification unique**:

### From Barkour (Multimodal Game Design)
- 🎮 **Vertical progression**: Climbing higher toward a goal (clouds → perfect dataset)
- 🏆 **Collecting rewards**: Gathering bacon → accumulating quality improvements
- ✨ **Visual delight**: Playful animations and satisfying feedback
- 🎯 **Flow state**: Balanced difficulty that keeps players engaged
- 🌈 **Multimodal feedback**: Visual, auditory, and tactile celebration

### Applied to Specimen Review
- 🌱 **Growth metaphor**: Not "completing tasks" but "cultivating a perfect dataset"
- 📈 **Vertical visualization**: Quality meter grows upward like a plant toward the sun
- 🔬 **Scientific meaning**: Each review = data refinement = step toward perfection
- 🧠 **Learning rewards**: Spaced repetition makes expertise visible and measurable
- 🏆 **Dual progress**: Both dataset (collective) AND reviewer (personal) improve

### The Magic Formula
