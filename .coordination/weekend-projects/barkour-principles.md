# Barkour Design Philosophy â†’ Specimen Review

**Context**: Multimodal game/app design principles developed through barkour playtesting
**Goal**: Apply proven engagement patterns to specimen review gamification

## What We Know

From barkour playtesting and multimodal design work, we've learned about:

1. **Multiple Input/Output Modalities**
2. **Accessibility-First Design**
3. **Engagement Loops**
4. **Progressive Difficulty**
5. **Flow State Optimization**

*(Fill in specifics from your barkour experience)*

## Questions to Inform Review Design

### From Barkour Experience:

**Engagement Patterns:**
- What kept playtesters engaged?
- When did they lose interest?
- What created "just one more" moments?
- How did difficulty ramping work?

**Multimodal Design:**
- Which modalities worked best together?
- How did you handle modality conflicts?
- What feedback loops were most effective?
- How did you balance visual/audio/haptic?

**Accessibility Wins:**
- What made it inclusive?
- Which features had unexpected benefits?
- How did different users approach it differently?
- What accessibility features became everyone's favorites?

**Progression Systems:**
- How did skill progression feel?
- What made achievements meaningful?
- How did you prevent burnout?
- What motivated return visits?

## Multimodal Review Architecture

Based on our v2 accessibility work + barkour principles:

```python
class MultimodalReviewEngine:
    """
    Combines:
    - Phase 2 accessibility architecture (visual + auditory + structured)
    - Barkour multimodal design principles
    - Gamification engagement loops
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.modalities = {
            "visual": VisualFeedback(),      # UI, colors, animations
            "auditory": AuditoryFeedback(),  # Sounds, screen reader
            "haptic": HapticFeedback(),      # Vibration patterns
            "structured": DataFeedback(),    # API responses, logs
        }

    def on_review_action(self, action: str, result: dict):
        """Provide feedback across all available modalities"""

        # Visual: Toast + animation
        self.modalities["visual"].show_achievement(result.badge)

        # Auditory: Sound effect + announcement
        self.modalities["auditory"].play_success_sound()
        self.modalities["auditory"].announce(result.message)

        # Haptic: Success pattern
        if result.achievement_unlocked:
            self.modalities["haptic"].pulse("achievement")

        # Structured: Log for analytics
        self.modalities["structured"].log_event(action, result)
```

## Prototype Ideas

### Weekend Experiment 1: Flow-Optimized Queue

**From barkour**: *(your flow optimization approach)*

**Applied to review**:
```python
class FlowOptimizedQueue:
    """
    Adaptively order specimens to maintain engagement
    Like barkour's difficulty curve
    """

    def get_next_specimen(self, reviewer_stats):
        # Start easy (warm-up)
        if reviewer_stats.session_reviews < 3:
            return self.get_easy_specimen()

        # Ramp up to challenge (flow state)
        elif reviewer_stats.current_streak > 5:
            return self.get_challenging_specimen()

        # Break up monotony
        elif reviewer_stats.time_on_current_type > 10:
            return self.get_different_type_specimen()

        # Default: match skill level
        else:
            return self.get_skill_matched_specimen()
```

### Weekend Experiment 2: Multimodal Feedback

**From barkour**: *(your feedback patterns)*

**Applied to review**:
```javascript
// When approving a specimen
function approveWithMultimodalFeedback(specimen) {
    // Visual: Green flash + confetti
    showSuccessAnimation();

    // Auditory: Pleasant ding + announcement
    playSound('approve.wav');
    announceToScreenReader(`Approved ${specimen.scientificName}`);

    // Haptic: Success pulse (if supported)
    if (navigator.vibrate) {
        navigator.vibrate([50, 30, 50]);
    }

    // Check for achievement
    if (checkForBadge()) {
        celebrateAchievement(); // Multi-modal celebration!
    }
}
```

### Weekend Experiment 3: Barkour-Style Progression

**From barkour**: *(your progression system)*

**Applied to review**:
- Start with high-quality specimens (tutorial level)
- Introduce one complexity at a time
- Gradually add challenging specimens
- Keep "boss battles" (critical priority) for experienced reviewers

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Solo Playtest (2-4 hours)
1. Implement one barkour-inspired feature
2. Review 50 specimens with it
3. Document engagement vs. baseline

### Phase 2: A/B Comparison (2-4 hours)
1. Review 25 specimens WITHOUT gamification
2. Review 25 specimens WITH gamification
3. Measure: time, enjoyment, quality

### Phase 3: Refinement (weekend 2)
1. Adjust based on findings
2. Add second barkour principle
3. Retest with 50 more specimens

## Success Metrics

**From barkour**, what made it successful?
- *(your metrics)*

**For specimen review**, success means:
- Reviewing more specimens per session
- Higher reviewer satisfaction
- Maintained/improved data quality
- People actually wanting to come back

## Design Principles to Preserve

From barkour playtesting, we learned:
1. *(principle 1)*
2. *(principle 2)*
3. *(principle 3)*

These should be NON-NEGOTIABLE in review gamification.

## Design Principles to Avoid

From barkour playtesting, we learned NOT to:
1. *(anti-pattern 1)*
2. *(anti-pattern 2)*
3. *(anti-pattern 3)*

These would make review gamification worse.

## Next Steps

**This weekend** (or next):
1. Fill in barkour-specific learnings above
2. Pick 1-2 principles to prototype
3. Build minimal implementation
4. Test with 50 specimens
5. Document results

**Later** (if successful):
1. Integrate into main review system
2. A/B test with real curators
3. Measure impact on throughput
4. Refine based on feedback

## Collaboration Opportunities

**Barkour â†’ Review knowledge transfer**:
- Design patterns document
- Multimodal feedback library (reusable!)
- Engagement measurement tools
- Accessibility testing framework

**Review â†’ Barkour feedback**:
- Real-world multimodal testing
- Different user base (scientists vs. gamers)
- Domain-specific challenges
- Performance under tedium
