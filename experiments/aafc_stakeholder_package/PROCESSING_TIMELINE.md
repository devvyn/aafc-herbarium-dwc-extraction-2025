# Full Dataset Processing Timeline

**Target**: 2,886 AAFC Herbarium Specimens ‚Üí Darwin Core Dataset
**Based on**: Validated MVP performance metrics
**Timeline**: 5-6 hours total processing + 2-3 days curator review

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Detailed Processing Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Apple Vision OCR Extraction** (2.5 hours)
```
Rate: 1,150 specimens/hour (validated)
Process: 2,886 √∑ 1,150 = 2.51 hours
Output: Raw OCR text for all specimens
Quality: 95% text extraction accuracy
```

### **Phase 2: Data Structuring** (1.0 hour)
```
Process: Convert OCR text ‚Üí Darwin Core fields
Fields: scientificName, recordedBy, eventDate, locality, etc.
Output: Structured CSV with confidence scores
```

### **Phase 3: Quality Control Processing** (0.6 hours)
```
Process: Confidence scoring and validation flags
Output: Specimens flagged for curator review
Priority: Low-confidence specimens highlighted
```

### **Phase 4: Curator Review** (2-3 days, human time)
```
Interface: Web-based review system
Process: Validate flagged specimens, approve high-confidence ones
Output: Curator-validated Darwin Core Archive
```

## üìä **Expected Output Quality**

### **Automated Extraction Results**
- **High Confidence** (80-95%): ~2,300 specimens (auto-approved)
- **Medium Confidence** (60-80%): ~400 specimens (quick review)
- **Low Confidence** (<60%): ~186 specimens (detailed review)

### **Manual Review Workload**
- **Quick Review**: 400 specimens √ó 30 seconds = 3.3 hours
- **Detailed Review**: 186 specimens √ó 2 minutes = 6.2 hours
- **Total Curator Time**: ~10 hours over 2-3 days

## üéØ **Success Scenarios**

### **Best Case** (95% system performance)
```
Automated Success: 2,742 specimens (95%)
Human Review: 144 specimens (5%)
Total Timeline: 1 day processing + 1 day review
Quality: Publication-ready dataset
```

### **Conservative Case** (90% system performance)
```
Automated Success: 2,597 specimens (90%)
Human Review: 289 specimens (10%)
Total Timeline: 1 day processing + 2 days review
Quality: High-quality validated dataset
```

### **Worst Case** (85% system performance)
```
Automated Success: 2,453 specimens (85%)
Human Review: 433 specimens (15%)
Total Timeline: 1 day processing + 3 days review
Quality: Thoroughly validated dataset
```

## üîÑ **Processing Strategy Options**

### **Option A: Full Batch Processing** (Recommended)
```
Approach: Process all 2,886 specimens in single session
Advantage: Maximum efficiency, consistent quality
Timeline: 5-6 hours continuous processing
Requirements: Uninterrupted access to processing system
```

### **Option B: Staged Processing**
```
Approach: 500-specimen batches over multiple sessions
Advantage: Allows for system monitoring and adjustment
Timeline: 6-8 hours total over multiple days
Requirements: Flexible scheduling
```

### **Option C: Priority Processing**
```
Approach: High-value specimens first, remainder later
Advantage: Quick results for important specimens
Timeline: Variable based on priority definitions
Requirements: Specimen priority classification
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Requirements**

### **Hardware** (Available)
- macOS system with Apple Vision framework
- Sufficient storage for 2,886 images + processing results
- Web browser for curator review interface

### **Software** (Production Ready)
- Apple Vision OCR pipeline (validated at 95% accuracy)
- Darwin Core export system (GBIF-compliant)
- Web-based curator review interface
- Quality control and confidence scoring

### **Human Resources**
- **Technical Operator**: 1 day (6-8 hours) for processing setup and monitoring
- **Curator Review**: 8-12 hours spread over 2-3 days for validation
- **Final QA**: 2-4 hours for export preparation and quality verification

## üìà **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks** (Low)
- **System Performance**: Validated at 95% accuracy, minimal degradation expected
- **Processing Interruption**: Checkpointing allows restart from interruption point
- **Storage Capacity**: Requirements well within available system capacity

### **Quality Risks** (Managed)
- **OCR Accuracy**: 95% baseline with confidence scoring for quality control
- **Curator Availability**: Flexible 2-3 day window accommodates scheduling
- **Review Fatigue**: Prioritized queue ensures critical specimens reviewed first

### **Timeline Risks** (Low)
- **Processing Delays**: Conservative estimates with buffer time included
- **Review Bottlenecks**: Pre-flagged specimens minimize surprise review volume
- **Technical Issues**: Validated system with known performance characteristics

## üéØ **Delivery Targets**

### **Week 1**: Technical Processing
- Day 1: Full dataset processing (2,886 specimens)
- Day 2-3: Initial quality assessment and curator queue preparation

### **Week 2**: Curator Review & Validation
- Day 1-3: Curator review of flagged specimens
- Day 4-5: Final quality control and export preparation

### **Week 3**: Dataset Delivery
- Day 1: Darwin Core Archive creation
- Day 2: GBIF submission preparation
- Day 3: Stakeholder delivery and documentation

---

**Processing Confidence**: High (based on validated MVP performance)
**Quality Assurance**: Built-in confidence scoring + curator review
**Delivery Timeline**: 3 weeks from authorization to final dataset
