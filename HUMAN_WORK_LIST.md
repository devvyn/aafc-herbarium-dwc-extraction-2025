# 👥 Human Work List - Critical Path Items for Project Success

**Priority**: High-impact tasks that only humans can complete to move this project from development to production use.

---

## 🚨 **URGENT - Week 1 Actions**

### **🔍 1. TEST ON REAL IMAGES** ⭐⭐⭐
**What**: Run OCR effectiveness testing on actual specimen photos
**Why**: We need to know if the code actually works on YOUR images
**Who**: You + research assistant
**Time**: 2-4 hours

```bash
# Commands to run:
python scripts/test_real_ocr_performance.py batch ./sample_images/ --summary
```

**Expected Output**: Real accuracy numbers for your specimen types
**Decision Point**: Does this work well enough to proceed?

---

### **🖼️ 2. GATHER REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE SAMPLES** ⭐⭐⭐
**What**: Collect 20-50 specimen photos representing different challenges
**Why**: Code needs to be tested on realistic variety, not cherry-picked examples
**Who**: You (institutional access required)
**Time**: 1-2 hours

**Image Types Needed**:
- ✅ **Clear typed labels** (5-10 images) - baseline performance
- ✅ **Handwritten labels** (5-10 images) - realistic challenge
- ✅ **Faded/damaged labels** (3-5 images) - worst-case scenarios
- ✅ **Multi-language labels** (3-5 images) - if applicable
- ✅ **Complex layouts** (3-5 images) - multiple labels per specimen

**Deliverable**: Folder of test images with known correct data for validation

---

### **📊 3. VALIDATE AGAINST KNOWN DATA** ⭐⭐
**What**: Compare OCR results against manually verified specimen data
**Why**: Need quantified accuracy metrics for stakeholder confidence
**Who**: Research assistant who knows the collection
**Time**: 3-4 hours

**Process**:
1. Take the test images from step 2
2. Manually record the "correct" data for each
3. Run OCR processing
4. Compare results field by field
5. Calculate accuracy percentages

**Deliverable**: Accuracy report with concrete numbers

---

## 🎯 **Week 2-3 Actions**

### **🔗 4. INTEGRATE WITH INSTITUTIONAL WORKFLOW** ⭐⭐⭐
**What**: Test export to your actual database/SharePoint system
**Why**: Technical success means nothing if data can't reach institutional systems
**Who**: You + IT person familiar with institutional systems
**Time**: 4-6 hours

**Steps**:
1. Process batch of real images
2. Export to format needed by institution (CSV/Excel/database)
3. Test import into institutional system
4. Verify data integrity through the complete pipeline

**Blockers to Resolve**:
- Authentication/permissions for institutional systems
- Data format requirements and field mapping
- Quality control approval workflow

---

### **📋 5. ESTABLISH QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS** ⭐⭐
**What**: Create workflow for human review of OCR results
**Why**: No OCR is 100% accurate; need systematic error correction
**Who**: Research assistants who will use this system
**Time**: 2-3 hours setup + ongoing

**Components Needed**:
- Review interface training (web UI vs spreadsheet)
- Error flagging and correction procedures
- Approval workflow before data export
- Performance monitoring and improvement tracking

**Deliverable**: Written procedure for quality control workflow

---

### **🎓 6. TRAIN RESEARCH ASSISTANTS** ⭐⭐
**What**: Hands-on training for people who will actually use the system
**Why**: Code is useless if users can't operate it effectively
**Who**: Research assistants + you
**Time**: 2-3 hours training session

**Training Topics**:
- Running OCR processing on image batches
- Using review interface to correct errors
- Exporting data to institutional formats
- Troubleshooting common problems

**Deliverable**: Trained users who can operate system independently

---

## 🔧 **Week 4+ Infrastructure Actions**

### **💾 7. SET UP PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT** ⭐⭐
**What**: Install and configure system for ongoing institutional use
**Why**: Development environment ≠ production environment
**Who**: IT support + you
**Time**: 4-8 hours

**Requirements**:
- Dedicated computer/server for processing
- Backup and data retention policies
- User access controls and permissions
- Integration with institutional storage systems

---

### **📈 8. ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE MONITORING** ⭐
**What**: Create metrics to track system effectiveness over time
**Why**: Need to demonstrate ROI and identify improvement opportunities
**Who**: Research coordinator + you
**Time**: 2-3 hours setup

**Metrics to Track**:
- Processing volume (images/week)
- Accuracy rates by specimen type
- Time savings vs manual data entry
- User satisfaction and adoption rates

---

## 🚫 **What Agents CANNOT Do (Human-Only Tasks)**

### **🤝 Relationship & Communication Tasks**
- ❌ **Negotiate with IT** about system integration requirements
- ❌ **Train users** on institutional-specific workflows
- ❌ **Get approvals** from supervisors for new procedures
- ❌ **Coordinate with GBIF** or other external organizations

### **🏛️ Institutional Integration Tasks**
- ❌ **Configure SharePoint/database connections** (credentials required)
- ❌ **Test export compatibility** with institutional systems
- ❌ **Establish data governance** policies and procedures
- ❌ **Get budget approval** for any required infrastructure

### **🔬 Domain Knowledge Tasks**
- ❌ **Validate taxonomic accuracy** against current nomenclature
- ❌ **Assess specimen identification** quality and consistency
- ❌ **Make curatorial decisions** about data handling
- ❌ **Determine institutional priorities** for digitization order

### **👀 Visual Assessment Tasks**
- ❌ **Evaluate image quality** from institutional perspective
- ❌ **Identify handwriting** of specific historical collectors
- ❌ **Assess label damage** and preservation needs
- ❌ **Determine processing priorities** based on collection value
