# Deployment Registry System

The user can provide a component name and options after `/deploy`. The input is available in `$ARGUMENTS`.

User input: $ARGUMENTS

## Quick Usage

```bash
/deploy                         # Show all deployable components
/deploy list                    # Show all deployable components
/deploy hybrid-orchestration    # Deploy bridge + native agent integration
/deploy specialized-agents      # Deploy Darwin Core, OCR, Pattern agents
/deploy bridge-extraction-plan  # Execute bridge system migration
```

## Implementation

Parse the arguments and execute the deployment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Parse arguments from user input
ARGS="$ARGUMENTS"
COMPONENT="${ARGS%% *}"  # First word is component
OPTIONS="${ARGS#* }"     # Rest are options

# Default to list if no component specified
if [ -z "$COMPONENT" ] || [ "$COMPONENT" = "$OPTIONS" ]; then
    COMPONENT="list"
    OPTIONS=""
fi
