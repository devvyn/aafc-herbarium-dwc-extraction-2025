Extract Darwin Core fields from this AAFC herbarium specimen image.

AAFC-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION PRIORITIES:

1. **catalogNumber (TOP of sheet):**
   - AAFC format: 6 digits with leading zeros (019121, 019570, 280522)
   - Location: Stamped or typed at TOP of herbarium sheet
   - Confidence boost: If you see 6-digit number at top = catalogNumber
   - Common error: Don't confuse with collector's field number on label

2. **scientificName (MUST include authority):**
   - AAFC standard: Always includes taxonomic authority
   - Examples: "Stipa viridula Trin.", "Bouteloua gracilis (HBK.) Lag.", "Festuca scabrella Torr."
   - Common prairie genera: Stipa, Festuca, Bouteloua, Agropyron, Elymus, Senecio, Artemisia
   - Watch for OCR errors in handwriting: "Festuca" not "Pestuue", "Stipa" not "Stlge"

3. **catalogNumber vs recordNumber distinction:**
   - catalogNumber = TOP (institutional, 6 digits) → 019121
   - recordNumber = BOTTOM LABEL (collector's field number, often near "COLL. No:") → may be 2-4 digits

4. **Saskatchewan prairie context:**
   - Default country: "CANADA"
   - Primary stateProvince: "Saskatchewan" (or "SASKATCHEWAN")
   - Common localities: Saskatchewan Landing, Beaver River crossing, Swift Current, Val Marie
   - Typical habitats: "native prairie", "fescue prairie", "mixed prairie", "coulee"

5. **recordedBy = ORIGINAL FIELD COLLECTOR (CRITICAL DISTINCTION):**
   - recordedBy is the person who collected the specimen IN THE FIELD from nature
   - Usually on collection label with date and locality: "Collected by J. Looman"
   - Common AAFC field collectors (1950s-1970s): J. Looman, A. C. Budd, W. P. Fraser
   - **NOT** the person who accessioned it to the herbarium
   - **NOT** the same as identifiedBy (who determined the species)
   - **NOT** the same as recordEnteredBy (who cataloged it)
   - If label says "det. J. Looman" without collection info, J. Looman is identifiedBy, NOT recordedBy

6. **Label keyword mapping:**
   - COLL: or COLL. No: → recordNumber
   - DET: or Det. → identifiedBy
   - HABITAT: or HAB: → habitat
   - ELEVATION: or ELEV: → minimumElevationInMeters

7. **locality vs habitat distinction:**
   - locality = GEOGRAPHIC PLACE NAME (Saskatchewan Landing, Beaver River crossing, etc.)
   - habitat = ECOSYSTEM/VEGETATION TYPE (native prairie, swampy area, fescue prairie, etc.)

8. **Comprehensive note extraction:**
   - occurrenceRemarks: ALL marginal notes, observations, abundance notes, collector comments
     * Examples: "abundant", "rare", "growing with Artemisia", "south-facing slope"
   - identificationRemarks: ALL determination notes, verification stamps, revisions
     * Examples: "verified by A.C. Budd", "det. J. Looman 1970", "originally Festuca ovina"
   - fieldNotes: Complete field notes if present on label
   - **DO NOT IGNORE:** Small handwritten notes, stamps, annotations, verification dates

9. **Specimen characteristics to capture:**
   - reproductiveCondition: Flowering, fruiting, sterile, in bud (if noted)
   - establishmentMeans: Native, introduced, cultivated (prairie species usually native)
   - associatedTaxa: Other species mentioned ("growing with...", "among...")
   - individualCount: Number if noted ("3 plants", "several specimens")
   - lifeStage: Seedling, mature, etc. (if noted)
   - sex: Male/female for dioecious species

10. **Institutional fields (if visible):**
    - institutionCode: "AAFC"
    - collectionCode: "SRDC" or herbarium code
    - basisOfRecord: "PreservedSpecimen"

11. **Coordinate metadata (if coordinates present):**
    - geodeticDatum: "WGS84" (modern) or "NAD27" (older records)
    - coordinateUncertaintyInMeters: If noted

QUALITY CHECKS:
- ✅ catalogNumber has 6 digits with leading zeros
- ✅ scientificName includes authority (Trin., Pursh, Torr., Lag.)
- ✅ stateProvince is "Saskatchewan" (not "SK" abbreviation)
- ✅ habitat describes ecosystem, not location
- ✅ recordNumber is from label, not top of sheet
- ✅ ALL marginal notes captured in occurrenceRemarks or identificationRemarks
- ✅ Verification stamps and annotations extracted

**COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION PRIORITY:**
Capture EVERYTHING on the label - all notes, annotations, stamps, marginal writing.
If uncertain where to put information, use occurrenceRemarks or identificationRemarks.
Better to extract too much than to miss important specimen notes.

Return JSON with ALL Darwin Core fields (~25+ fields total), even if many have empty values.
Set confidence 0.0 for missing/illegible fields.
