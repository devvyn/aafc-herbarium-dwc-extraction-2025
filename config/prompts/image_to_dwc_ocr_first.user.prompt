Extract Darwin Core fields from this AAFC herbarium specimen image using a two-pass OCR strategy.

PASS 1: Extract all visible text with spatial locations
- List everything you can read
- Note where each text element is located (TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM-LABEL, ANNOTATIONS)
- Don't interpret yet, just transcribe

PASS 2: Structure the OCR text into Darwin Core fields
- Map TOP text → catalogNumber (6-digit institutional ID)
- Map BOTTOM-LABEL → scientific name, collector, date, locality, habitat
- Map ANNOTATIONS → identification notes, remarks
- Assign confidence based on text clarity in Pass 1

Key mappings:
- recordedBy = Original field collector (who collected it in nature)
- locality = Geographic place name
- habitat = Ecosystem/vegetation type
- scientificName = Species + authority (Trin., Torr., Lag., etc.)

Return JSON with all available Darwin Core fields.
