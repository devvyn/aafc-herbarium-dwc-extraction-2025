# AAFC Herbarium DWC Extraction - Multi-Agent Collaboration Workspace

**Context Level**: 3 (Project-Specific)
**Inherits From**: `~/devvyn-meta-project/CLAUDE.md` (Bridge v3.0, coordination protocols)
**User Tools**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (fd, uv, rg tool preferences)

**Framework Version**: 2.1 (Inclusive Collaboration Design)
**Project Tier**: 1 (Production-Critical)
**Agent Authority**: Technical implementation, pattern application, optimization
**Human Authority**: Scientific validation, stakeholder communication, strategic priorities

## Project Context

This toolkit extracts Darwin Core data from herbarium specimen images using OCR and AI assistance. Built for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) with production-ready processing capabilities.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Benefits

### Agent Strengths Applied
- **Pattern Recognition**: Implementing proven gist patterns from historical development
- **Technical Optimization**: OCR engine evaluation, performance tuning, code quality
- **Architecture Decisions**: Pipeline design, error handling, modular system structure
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, validation protocols, data integrity

### Human Domain Preserved
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Taxonomic validation, specimen interpretation, domain expertise
- **Stakeholder Relations**: AAFC communication, requirements gathering, success criteria
- **Strategic Direction**: Research priorities, publication planning, institutional goals
- **Quality Standards**: Acceptable accuracy thresholds, output format requirements

## Shared Authority Implementation

### Git Commit Protocol (CRITICAL)

**Rule**: Commit and push every 30-45 minutes of development work or after completing any significant feature.

**When to commit**:
- ‚úÖ After implementing a new feature or module
- ‚úÖ After fixing a bug or passing new tests
- ‚úÖ Before starting a risky refactor
- ‚úÖ After creating important documentation
- ‚úÖ Every 30-45 minutes during active development

**Commit checklist**:
1. `git status` - Review changes
2. `git add <files>` - Stage relevant changes (exclude test directories)
3. `git commit -m "..."` - Write clear commit message
4. `git push` - Push to GitHub immediately

**Why**: GitHub is the safe storage. Local work can be lost to crashes, context limits, or session ends. Frequent commits = no wipeout moments.

### Technical Implementation (Agent Authority)

**Pre-Commit Checks** (run before EVERY commit):
```bash
# Quick check (always run before commit)
uv run ruff check . --fix && \
uv run ruff format . && \
uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q && \
git diff --check

# Full checks (for significant changes)
uv run python -m pytest tests/  # All tests
./test-regression.sh            # Regression validation
```

**Development Workflows**:
```bash
# Code quality
uv run ruff check src/ --fix    # Auto-fix issues
uv run ruff format src/         # Format code

# Testing
uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/     # Fast unit tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/          # Full test suite
./test-regression.sh                     # Database compatibility

# Integration testing
uv run python cli.py check-deps         # Verify dependencies
```

**Commit Frequency**:
- Every 30-45 minutes during active development
- After completing any significant feature
- Before starting risky refactors
- **ALWAYS after running pre-commit checks**

See [.github/PRE_COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md](.github/PRE_COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md) for complete workflow.

### Scientific Validation (Human Authority)
- Specimen identification accuracy assessment
- Darwin Core field mapping verification
- Taxonomic authority validation
- Output format compliance review

### Collaborative Decision Points

- **People**: Devvyn Murphy, supervisor, AAFC-SRDC organization
- **Policies**: Public employee policies, public scientific data (no confidentiality concerns)

### Clue-Based Context

**When you mention these keywords**, I know we're in herbarium work context:

- "AAFC", "SRDC", "Agriculture Canada"
- "OCR", "biodiversity", "scientific data"

### Context Logging

**Actions logged** to `~/.kb-conduit/logs/session.log` for:
- Debriefing agents (understand what was accomplished)
- Concierge agents (coordinate between work and personal contexts)
- Handoff between sessions (continuity)

**Load context**: Run `~/.kb-conduit/load-context.sh` at session start
